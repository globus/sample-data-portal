# Globus Sample Data Portal

The Globus Sample Data Portal is an implementation of the Modern Research Data Portal design pattern[^1].

If you are looking to build your own data portal, Globus provides several solutions and integration options meant to fit your requirements.

## Serverless Portals

Our Serverless Portals require no additional managed infrastructure to enable your end-users access to many Globus capabilities. The portals are open-source, client-side, single-page applications maintained by the Globus team â€“ using our template repositories you can deploy a custom portal with a few clicks.

- Data Distribution ([https://github.com/globus/template-data-portal](https://github.com/globus/template-data-portal))
  - **The Globus Sample Data Portal is an example of this template!**
- Data Discovery and Access ([https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal](https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal))

## Django-based Portals

The [Django Globus Portal Framework](https://django-globus-portal-framework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a collection of tools for quickly bootstrapping a portal for Globus Search.


## Integrating Globus Capabilities into Applications

If you are looking to integrate Globus capabilitities into an existing application, or planning to build your own application Globus offers first-class software developer kits for [Python](https://globus-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-javascript#readme), in addition to service-level APIs outlined in [our documentation](https://docs.globus.org/).
