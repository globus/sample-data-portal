# Globus Sample Data Portal

The Globus Sample Data Portal implements the Modern Research Data Portal design pattern[^1].

If you are looking to build your own data portal, Globus provides several solutions and integration options that will meet your requirements.

## Serverless Portals

Our Serverless Portals require no additional managed infrastructure to enable your end-users access to many Globus capabilities. The portals are open-source, client-side, single-page applications maintained by the Globus team. Using our template repositories, you can deploy a custom portal with a few clicks.

- Data Distribution ([https://github.com/globus/template-data-portal](https://github.com/globus/template-data-portal))
  - **The Globus Sample Data Portal is an example of this template!**
- Data Discovery and Access ([https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal](https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal))

## Django-based Portals

The [Django Globus Portal Framework](https://github.com/globus/django-globus-portal-framework) is a collection of tools that enable you to rapidly create an easily accessible portal for your data. Tailoring your portal to your data can be done simply by modifying existing bulit-in Bootstrap templates, allowing many levels of customization to suit the required needs.

You can find more information, installation and usage instructions on our [Read The Docs page](https://django-globus-portal-framework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Integrating Globus Capabilities into Applications

If you are looking to integrate Globus capabilities into an existing application or planning to build your own, Globus offers first-class software developer kits for [Python](https://globus-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-javascript#readme), in addition to service-level APIs outlined in [our documentation](https://docs.globus.org/).
